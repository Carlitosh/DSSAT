! all KCAN were 0.85. Does not affect LIFAC, only affects KEP, so use it that way? (Yes, KJB)
! For Global Futures project, RUE increased by 10%
! For Peter Craufurd's daylength experiment, RUE as per his publication
! TBASE - base temperature below which no development occurs, C
! TOPT - temperature at which maximum development rate occurs during vegetative stages, C
! ROPT - temperature at which maximum development rate occurs for reproductive stages, C
! DJTI - Minimum days from end of juvenile stage to tassel initiation if the cultivar
! 	       is not photoperiod sensitive, days
! GDDE - Growing degree days per cm seed depth required for emergence, GDD/cm
! RUE - Radiation use efficiency, g plant dry matter/MJ PAR
! KCAN - Canopy light extinction coefficient for daily PAR.
